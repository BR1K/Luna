# Luna

## An arcade-style game inspired by Atari's 1979 classic, Lunar Lander.

### Instructions

  Luna needs your help landing safely on the moon. After a long trip from Earth, Luna has entered
  the moon's orbit with limited fuel, and must now fly over rough and unforgiving terrain in order
  to find a relatively flat area to land on.

  Use the right and left arrow keys to rotate Luna clockwise and counter-clockwise, respectively.
  Use the up arrow key, or the spacebar to fire the thruster and steer Luna to a safe landing area. This will consume fuel.
  Luna's fuel is limited, so fire the thruster wisely!

### Technologies
